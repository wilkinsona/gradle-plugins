Provides some sanity checks to ensure the plugin is working.

Using JDK6 run the following command:

```
gradlew clean build springIoCheck -PJDK8_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0.jdk/Contents/Home -PJDK7_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_40.jdk/Contents/Home --continue
```

NOTE: You will need to replace JDK7_HOME and JDK8_HOME with the paths to your JDK locations

You should expect something similar to the following output:

```
